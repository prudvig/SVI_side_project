	- Data sometimes has a long tail for most variables. One option is to considering binning them to get rid of this issue
	- Rio Arriba county, NM removed to get rid of the outliers that are in the long tail of the data
	- Note that confidence intervals and z-scores are being dropped from the national county health dataset. Not sure what information is stored
	  in here but it's being omitted from the dataset
	- Created a running list of useful functions called useful_functions.py
	- Subset the national county health dataset down to just a few variables
	- Priority To Do for tomorrow:
		- Add in drunk driving fatalities to the dataset
		- Create the rank ordered and "at-risk" variables in the nch dataset
		- Create a table of variables and see what else can be included in the predictive model for suicidality, overdose deaths, drunk driving fatalities

	- Consider including mental health provider ratio in the data by removing all the data up to the colon

	- At a point where it seems like it will take me some time to generate the code in Python to do all the logistic regression.
	  It's easy in R but a bit more challenging in Python
	- Add in to Rmarkdown file section for doing ANOVA after consulation with Dr. LaBarr
	- To do for tomorrow:
		- Check out variables from the county health dataset to use in a logistic regression model (might need to do some data processing)
		- Create new logistic regression model using this
		- Create models using other algorithms that we've learned in class

	- Feature creation ideas
		- Ratio of access to exercise opportunities to obesity/physically inactive/obesity/smokers
		- Ratio of food environment index to obesity/physically inactive/smokers
		- Access to healthy lifestyle which is multiplication of access to exercise * food environment index
		- Mental health providers and primary care physicians/area (remember to drop mental health providers)
		- New ratio looking at Uninsured population to primary care and mental health provider ratio [Actually just an interaction term for uninsured and mental health providers]
		- Maybe a new variable looking at % limited access to healthy foods/area (this variable is about how challenging is it to get to healthy food)
			- Not sure how useful this is. It might already be factored into the calculation of this variable
		- Median Household Income/Unemployment Rate
		- Mental Health Provider Ratio / Mental Health Distress 
	- Things to fix
		- Fix ratios such that they are correctly calculated
		- Fix variable name for % Uninsured_y and % Uninsured.1 to % Uninsured Adults and % Uninsured Children
		- Rename Segretation index and Segregation Index to Black/White Segregation Index and Non-White/White Segregation Index
	- Presence of water violation is a factor binary variable (remember this when building future logistic regression model)
	- Missing values are imputed using k-nearest neighbors approach (used this because figured counties with similar kinds of features would likely have similar values for the numbers that were missing)
